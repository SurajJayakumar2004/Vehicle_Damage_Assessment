# CNN Filter Visualization Tools 🔍

This directory contains tools to analyze and visualize what your Vehicle Damage Assessment CNN model has learned. These tools help you understand how your fraud detection model processes images by showing filter kernels, feature maps, and activation patterns.

## 📁 Files Overview

### 2. `simple_filter_analyzer.py` - Command Line Tool
A lightweight Python script for quick analysis.

**Features:**
- 🔍 Filter visualization using matplotlib
- 📈 Feature map generation
- 📊 Statistical analysis
- 📋 Comprehensive report generation
- 💻 Command-line interface

### 3. `filter_requirements.txt` - Dependencies
Required Python packages for the tools.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Interactive Web App (Recommended)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r filter_requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run filter_visualization.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`)

### Option 2: Command Line Tool

1. **Install basic dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib pillow numpy
   ```

2. **Run interactive mode:**
   ```bash
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py
   ```

3. **Or use command line arguments:**
   ```bash
   # Analyze specific layer
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py --model_path your_model.h5 --layer conv2d_1
   
   # Generate feature maps for an image
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py --model_path your_model.h5 --layer conv2d_1 --image_path damage.jpg
   
   # Generate comprehensive report
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py --model_path your_model.h5 --report
   ```

## 📊 What You'll Learn

### 1. Filter Kernels
- **What they show:** The actual learned weights of convolutional filters
- **Interpretation:** 
  - Dark areas = negative weights
  - Light areas = positive weights
  - Patterns reveal what features the filter detects (edges, textures, shapes)

### 2. Feature Maps
- **What they show:** How filters respond to actual images
- **Interpretation:**
  - Bright areas = strong activation (filter detected its target feature)
  - Dark areas = little activation
  - Different maps highlight different aspects of damage

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Metrics provided:**
  - **Mean/Std:** Weight distribution characteristics
  - **Sparsity:** Percentage of near-zero weights (pruning potential)
  - **L1/L2 Norms:** Filter magnitude measures
  - **Min/Max:** Weight ranges

## 🔍 Understanding Your Model

### Early Layers (conv2d_1, conv2d_2)
- **Purpose:** Detect basic features
- **Typical patterns:** Edges, corners, simple textures
- **Vehicle damage context:** Scratches, dents, sharp edges

### Middle Layers (conv2d_3, conv2d_4)
- **Purpose:** Combine basic features into complex patterns
- **Typical patterns:** Shapes, textures, object parts
- **Vehicle damage context:** Damage patterns, surface irregularities

### Deep Layers (conv2d_5+)
- **Purpose:** High-level feature detection
- **Typical patterns:** Complex objects, semantic features
- **Vehicle damage context:** Fraud indicators, suspicious patterns

## 🎯 Fraud Detection Insights

### What to Look For:

1. **Legitimate Damage Patterns:**
   - Consistent edge detection in early layers
   - Natural damage progression in deeper layers
   - Coherent activation patterns

2. **Fraudulent Indicators:**
   - Unusual activation patterns
   - Inconsistent damage edges
   - Artificial-looking features in deep layers

3. **Model Health:**
   - Diverse filter patterns (not all similar)
   - Reasonable sparsity levels (10-30%)
   - Progressive complexity through layers

## 📋 Example Analysis Workflow

1. **Start with Layer Overview:**
   ```bash
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py --model_path your_model.h5
   ```

2. **Examine Early Layers:**
   ```bash
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py --model_path your_model.h5 --layer conv2d_1
   ```

3. **Test with Sample Images:**
   ```bash
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py --model_path your_model.h5 --layer conv2d_3 --image_path sample_damage.jpg
   ```

4. **Generate Full Report:**
   ```bash
   python simple_filter_analyzer.py --model_path your_model.h5 --report
   ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found
- Place your trained model (`vehicle_damage_fraud_model.h5`) in the same directory
- Or specify the full path using `--model_path`

### Memory Issues
- Reduce the number of filters visualized using `--num_filters 8`
- Use smaller images for feature map generation

### Visualization Issues
- Ensure matplotlib backend is properly configured
- Try different image formats (PNG vs JPG)

## 📈 Advanced Usage

### Custom Analysis
Modify the scripts to:
- Add new statistical metrics
- Change visualization styles
- Implement custom layer comparisons
- Add export functionality

### Integration with Training
Use these tools during model development to:
- Monitor filter learning progress
- Identify overfitting patterns
- Optimize architecture choices
- Debug training issues
